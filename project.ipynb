    "Every year, extreme weather events cause damage to homes across the United States, many of which are insured. For a property insurance carrier, it is important to model the risks and expected losses that arise from underwriting home insurance policies, especially in states that experience a high frequency of extreme weather events. Thus, this project aims to use FEMA data to model the claims, expected losses, and profits that an insurer might face in states like Florida and Washington. I am personally interested in exploring this problem because I am an aspiring actuary and would like to explore Catastrophe Modeling as applied to the property insurance space, which is full of complex problems and real-world implications.\n",
    "\n",
    "I began by collecting data from FEMA's National Risk Index resources, which included fields like proprietary risk scores and Expected Annual Loss (EAL) on a county level. Taking the EAL and other assumptions about the insurance carrier, like its market share, base claim rate, and the average value of the homes it insures in each state, Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) are fitted to predict the severity and frequency parameters for distributions that are then used to model claims in a Monte Carlo simulation. In the claims simulation step, typical insurance policy mechanics like deductibles and coinsurance rates are modeled with "

    "I am interested in exploring how an insurance company decides whether or not to underwrite policies (i.e. provide insurance) in areas or states that experience a high number of extreme-weather events. This task requires modeling the frequency and severity of potential claims that may occur\\, in order to understand the potential costs an insurer may face in such an area.\n",
    "\n",
    "Significance of the Problem: I am personally interested in exploring this problem because I am an aspiring actuary, which is a risk professional who typically works with insurance companies to forecast future outcomes and their financial costs. The problem itself is interesting because of the dynamic and costly nature of weather-related catastrophes, as climate change and new regulations continually affects the Property & Casualty insurance indsutry. For example, California passed new legislation this Summer which allows insurance companies to develop Wildfire Catastrophe Models to aid their fire insurance underwriting, whereas beforehand, most companies chose to stay out of California by default because of the high-level of risk that they were not allowed to properly estimate.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Potential computational tools: Monte Carlo or other stochastic simulations can be useful in forecasting a set of potential outcomes in this problem by randomly generating factors like total claim costs in a given state, which are the primary expense for insurance companies, and therefore an important indicator of whether a state that experiences frequent weather catastrophes is a viable market. If sufficient data exists for training, other Machine Learning approaches like Generalized Linear Models (commonly used by actuaries) or XGBoost can be deployed to predict expected losses or claim probabilities.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, I hope to gain some experience in exploring complex problems in the insurance industry, especially in a practice as dense and dynamic as Catastrophe Modeling. I am excited to see how my project evolves from making naive assumptions in the model to hopefully growing in its faithfulness to real-world scenarios by incorporating more data-driven methods."
