    "Every year, extreme weather events cause damage to homes across the United States, many of which are insured. For a property insurance carrier, it is important to model the risks and expected losses that arise from underwriting home insurance policies, especially in states that experience a high frequency of extreme weather events. Thus, this project aims to use FEMA data to model the claims, expected losses, and profits that an insurer might face in states like Florida and Washington. I am personally interested in exploring this problem because I am an aspiring actuary and would like to explore Catastrophe Modeling as applied to the property insurance space, which is full of complex problems and real-world implications.\n",

    "I began by collecting data from FEMA's National Risk Index, which provides county-level metrics like proprietary natural hazard risk scores and Expected Annual Loss (EAL). Taking the EAL and other assumptions about the insurer- such as market share, baseline claim rate, and average insured home value- Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) are fitted to estimate frequency and severity parameters for the underlying claim distributions. Monte Carlo simulation and numerical quadrature is used to capture typical insurance policy mechanics like deductibles and coinsurance rates, which factor into estimating the expected profit for the insurer in each state."

    "Property insurance carriers are interested in understanding the risks, as well as the payoffs and potential profits involved in underwriting policies (i.e. providing insurance contracts) in a given market. This involves modeling the expected losses and premiums that the insurer could face, as well as modeling tail-end outcomes that correspond to a year with a high frequency and/or severity of extreme weather events that trigger claims (i.e. liabilities for the insurer) to be filed. These model considerations are especially important for insurers underwriting policies in states that experience relatively many extreme weather events, like Florida and Washington.\n",
    "\n",
    "Florida is notorious for its exposure to hurricanes, while Washington is a geographically diverse state that normally experiences torrential rainfall, flooding, wildfires, and winter storms. Overall, climate is one of the most important considerations when creating insurance models that forecast losses and profits in any state. Climate change and new regulations continually affect the property insurance indsutry, making the problem of financial forecasting a dynamic and crucial one for insurers. To illustrate, California passed new legislation this Summer which allows insurance companies to develop Wildfire Catastrophe Models to aid their fire insurance underwriting, whereas beforehand, most companies chose to stay out of California by default because of the high-level of risk that they were not allowed to properly estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the impact of this forecasting problem extends far beyond just predicting a hypothetical insurance company's bottom line– the financial well-beings of homeowners are also at stake when an insurer develops such a model, as it helps them design the terms of insurance policies in a given area. However, this project is not a full-fledged catastrophe model that considers several types of perils (e.g. fire, flood). This project is an end-to-end model that takes FEMA National Risk Index data, which is publicly available on a county level, to fit statistical models and run Monte Carlo simulations to forecast claims in the states of Florida and Washington. Also, numerical integration is used to solve one form of a classical profit equation in insurance, as follows.\n",

    "The project models insured losses and profits for a small insurer in the states of Florida and Washington by by combining a traditional frequency-severity statistical model with stochastic Monte Carlo simulations and deterministic numerical integration. There are 3 computational stages in the model pipeline:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Parameter estimation and perturbation for underlying claim distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned previously, the FEMA data provides county-level data that is fitted by two complementary Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) for the classic Frequency-Severity approach. Breaking down losses into the frequency and severity of claims is natural, as the total cost of the claims an insurer can expect to be liable for is total number of claims * expected cost of claims.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Frequency GLM models the claim counts $Y_i$ per county $i$ with the Poisson distribution with mean $\\mu_i$, which is the canonical choice for modeling count data in actuarial applications. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Y_i \\sim \\text{Poisson}(\\mu_i), \\; \\text{log}(\\mu_i)=\\text{log}(\\text{exposure}_i) + x_i\\beta$$\n",
    "$$\\implies \\mu_i =\\text{exposure}_i * \\text{exp}(x_i\\beta)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the logarithmic link makes the predictor $x_i$ a coefficient that multiplies our rate $\\mu_i$, which is interpretable since the predictor $x_i$ is FEMA's proprietary risk score for each county, rescaled to $\\in[0,1]$. The exposure offset allows the rate to be modeled per unit of exposure, where exposure is the number of homes in a state times the market share of the insurer (i.e. the number of policies in their portfolio).\n",
    "\n",
    "Because actual claim count data is not publicly available, I construct a synthetic expected count using a baseline claim rate (CITE) and county exposures:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{num claims}_i^{\\text{target}} = \\text{exposure}_i \\times \\text{base rate} \\times \\text{risk rel}_i $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The Severity GLM models the severity $X_i$ (i.e. cost) per claim with a Gamma GLM and log link:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$X_i \\sim \\text{Gamma}(\\mu_i, \\; \\phi \\mu_i^2), \\; log(\\mu_i)=x_i \\eta,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\phi$ is a scale parameter. Gamma is a good distribution choice for cost data because claim severities are positive, continuous, and right-skewed (CITE). The interpretation of the log link is that a unit increase in the predictor multiplies $\\mu$ by $e^{\\eta_j} (what?).\n",
    "\n",
    "Both GLMs are estimated by IRLS with the GLM.fit() method. Finite-difference gradient checks are conducted and condition numbers of the design matrix are computed later to ensure the GLM outputs are well-conditioned.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, these baseline actuarial parameters derived by the GLMs are perturbed stochastically before Monte Carlo simulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{Poisson: } \\lambda_{\\text{sim}} = \\lambda_(\\text{base})(1+\\epsilon_\\lambda), \\epsilon_\\lambda \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma_\\lambda^2),$$\n",
    "$$\\text{Gamma: } \\mu_{\\text{sim}} = \\mu_(\\text{base})(1+\\epsilon_\\mu), \\epsilon_\\mu \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma_\\mu^2).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This step introduces controlled uncertainty to reflect the g=heterogeneity of different counties in each state and model misspecification.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Monte Carlo and Numerical Integration for simulating claims and profits\n",
    "\n",
    "The claim counts for each county on each Monte Carlo draw (N_SIM=10,000) is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$N \\sim \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda_{\\text{sim}})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of simulating individual claim severities, which would be computationally expensive and subject to Monte Carlo noise, the expected payout per claim is computed according to a standard policy scheme that includes a deductible $d$ and the coinsurance rate $c$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E[(X-d)^+] * c = c * \\int_d^{\\infty} (x-d)f_X(x)dx, \\; \\; X \\sim \\Gamma(k, \\; \\theta)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "A numerical integration approach is appropriate here because the deductible truncates the Gamma distribution, and so this integral has no closed-form expression. The implementation in the next cell evaluates the integral using n-point Gauss-Legendre quadrature:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\int_d^u g(x)dx \\approx \\sum_{i=1}^n w_i g(t_i),$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $t_i, w_i$ are the Legendre nodes and weights mapped $[-1,1] \\to [d,u]$, and $u$, the 99.99th percentile of the Gamma distribution, is set as the upper bound of integration. This approach is a deterministic and numerically stable way of estimating the expected loss per claim.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each simulation trial,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{CountyLoss}_j = N_j * E[(X-d)^+] * c$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and the losses for each state are accumulated across each of its counties.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Compute financial outcomes and Bootstrap Confidence Intervals\n",
    "\n",
    "Premiums are calculated by multiplying the expected loss in a state by 1.2 to each Monte Carlo simulation of each state's loss. Then profits are premiums - loss per simulation for each state, which yields an empirical distribution of potential financial outcomes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using the empirical loss distribution from our simulations, risk measures like the Value at Risk and Tail Value at Risk are taken as the empirical 5th percentile of profit and the mean of the worst 5% of profit outcomes, respectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "A 95% confidence interval for the expected profit is constructed using nonparametric bootstrap resampling, which produces uncertainty bands without assuming normality:\n",
